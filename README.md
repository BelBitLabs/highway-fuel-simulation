## Overview:
This project simulates highway driving conditions in order to test and analyze vehicle emissions and fuel economy or efficiency.  
The program processes input velocity data and applies multiple numerical methods to calculate and compare results,  
which provides insight into vehicle performance under different conditions.  

**Simplified Version:**  
This project analyzes highway driving in order to study and measure the amount of pollution a vehicle transmits and gas that it uses.  
This program analyzes changes in velocity data under different driving conditions by applying several calculations/numerical methods,  
and then finally compares those results under each condition the car was tested under.  

---

## Features:
- Reads in velocity/time data and processes it using C++  
- Implements *Forward Difference* and *Central Difference* formulas  
- Uses *Simpson’s Rule* and *Trapezoidal Rule* to calculate distance traveled  
- Calculates percent difference between methods for accuracy comparison  
- Outputs results and plots graphs for visualization  

---

## Technologies Used:
- **Languages**: C++  
- **IDEs**: DEV C++ or Visual Studio  
- **Tools**: GitHub (version control)  
- **Computational/Numerical Methods**:Simpson’s Rule, Trapezoidal Rule, Forward Difference, Central Difference

## How to Run: Follow the listed steps in chronological order:  
You can run this C++ program in two different ways:  

---

### 🔹 Option 1: Using an IDE (Most Common for Windows Users):
1.  Clone this repo:  
   ```bash

   git clone git@github.com:MPaillant7/Dynamics-Problem-1.1---Project.git



  2. Open the repo folder in an IDE (such as DEV C++ or Visual Studio).
  3. Build/compile the program (usually a ▶️ Run or Build button).
  4. Run the program directly from the IDE to see the output in the console and graphs.

### 🔹  Option 2: Using the Command Line (g++ compiler):
If you have g++ installed (via MinGW, Linux, or macOS t:erminal):

1. Clone this Repo:

git clone git@github.com:MPaillant7/Dynamics-Problem-1.1---Project.git

2. Go into the repo folder:

cd Dynamics-Problem-1.1---Project

3. Compile the program:

g++ Dynamics_Problem_1.cpp -o dynamics

4. Run the program:
./dynamics
